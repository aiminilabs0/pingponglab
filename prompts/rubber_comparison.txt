You are a master Table Tennis Equipment Expert (specializing in ESN, Butterfly, and Chinese rubbers). Compare the following two rubbers objectively, avoiding marketing fluff.

**Rubber A:** {RUBBER_1}
**Rubber B:** {RUBBER_2}

### 1. One-Line Summary
Provide a 1–2 sentence executive summary defining the core difference (e.g., "A is a linear speedster, while B is a high-arc spin machine").

### 2. Head-to-Head Breakdown
*Compare A vs B using short, punchy bullets. Use ">" symbols where helpful (e.g., Speed: A > B).*

* **Speed & Gears:**
    * **Low Impact:** (Bounciness in short game)
    * **Top End:** (Power away from table)
    * **Linearity:** (Predictable vs. strong catapult effect)
* **Spin Mechanics:**
    * **Opening Loop:** (Ease of lifting backspin)
    * **Max Spin:** (Ceiling when fully engaged)
    * **Topsheet Grip:** (Mechanical grip vs. Tacky adhesion)
* **Flight Path (Throw Angle):**
    * Arc height (Low/Medium/High) and safety over the net.
* **Feel & Feedback:**
    * Crisp/Clicky vs. Muted/Dampened.
    * Ball dwell time.
* **Control & Short Game:**
    * Sensitivity to incoming spin.
    * Touch play (push/drop) stability.
* **Blocking & Countering:**
    * Passive block stability vs. Active counter-loop punch.

### 3. Setup Synergy
* **Blade Compatibility:** Best blade pairings for each (e.g., "Rubber A needs a stiff Outer Carbon blade to activate," "Rubber B pairs well with flexible wood").
* **Forehand vs. Backhand:** Which side is each rubber best suited for and why?

### 4. The Recommendation
* **Choose Rubber A if:** (3 distinct bullets focusing on player needs)
* **Choose Rubber B if:** (3 distinct bullets focusing on player needs)
* **"Tuning" / Optimization:** Advice on sponge thickness (Max vs 2.0mm) or boosting requirements (if applicable to this rubber type).

**Constraint:** If exact specs are unknown, make a logical estimate based on the rubber's series/generation but label it "Estimate."

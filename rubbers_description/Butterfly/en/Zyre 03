## 1. One-Line Summary

* The Hook: A relentless offensive weapon that bridges the gap between the mechanical spin of Dignics and the catapult feel of Tenergy.
* Archetype: Variable Attacker / Power Looper.

## 2. Performance Analysis

* Speed & Gears:
** Passive Block Speed: High. The tensioned top sheet provides an immediate rebound, requiring soft hands to absorb power against heavy loops.
** Active Loop Speed: Explosive. When the "Spring Sponge Z" is fully compressed, the release velocity rivals the fastest ESN rubbers on the market.
** Linearity: Non-linear. It possesses a distinct "kick" (trampoline effect) at medium-high impact, which assists in mid-distance rallies but requires adjustment for touch play.
* Spin Generation:
** Top End: Elite. The grip is mechanical rather than tacky, allowing for massive rotation on power loops where the ball bites deep into the top sheet.
** Opening Loop: Forgiving. The high-friction surface grabs the plastic ball easily, allowing for safe, high-arc openers against heavy backspin.
* Control & Short Game:
** Touch Play: Demanding. The inherent bounciness makes keeping drop shots short difficult without precise wrist tension.
** Sensitivity: High. It reacts significantly to incoming spin, demanding active stroke mechanics rather than passive guiding.
* Throw Angle (Arc):
** Trajectory: Medium-High. It naturally clears the net with a safe margin, ideal for lifting underspin.
** Clearance: Travels long. The ball dips aggressively late in the trajectory (the "Dignics Dive") rather than floating out.

## 3. The "Hand Feel" Experience

* Impact Sensation:
** Hardness: Crisp / Medium-Hard. Estimated at 48-50 degrees (Butterfly Scale), it feels firmer than Tenergy 05 but softer than Dignics 09C.
** Feedback: Direct and sharp. You feel a distinct "click" and ball-bite moment, giving precise information on whether you grazed or hit through the ball.
* Dwell Time:
** Sensation: Paradoxical. It feels snappy on light touches but offers extended hold (dwell) on full swings, allowing players to "carry" the ball.

## 4. Compatibility Guide

* Best Blade Matches:
** Outer Carbon: Excellent match. The rubber's high arc complements the lower throw of ALC (Arylate-Carbon) or Super ALC blades (e.g., Viscaria, Fan Zhendong ALC).
** Inner Carbon / All-Wood: Good for control. Pairing with an Innerforce layer tames the speed, making it manageable for developing advanced players.
* Ball Suitability:
** ABS Plastic: Optimized. The top sheet composition is specifically tuned to prevent slippage on the slick surface of new ABS balls (Nittaku 3-Star, DHS DJ40+).

## 5. Pros & Cons

* Pros:
** Massive dynamic range allows for both slow spinny loops and flat kill shots.
** "Auto-correct" throw angle helps lift balls even when out of position.
** Durability of the top sheet is superior to previous generations (resistant to edge chipping).
* Cons:
** High price point typical of flagship Butterfly equipment.
** High sensitivity to incoming spin makes service receive challenging for intermediate players.
** Requires high racket head speed to activate the full potential of the sponge.

## 6. Recommended Users & Pairings

* Who Should Buy This:
** Two-winged loopers who play at mid-distance and rely on rally dominance.
** Advanced competitors looking to upgrade from Tenergy 05 for more power with the plastic ball.
* Who Should Avoid This:
** Passive blockers or flat hitters who dislike high-throw rubbers.
** Developing players who have not yet mastered spin reading (the rubber will punish poor reads).
* Similar Alternatives:
** Same Brand: For a softer, more controllable version, try Tenergy 05FX or Glayzer.
** Rival Brand: If you like the speed but want a more linear feel, try Tibhar Evolution MX-P or Xiom Omega VII Pro.

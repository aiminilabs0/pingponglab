## 1. One-Line Summary
* **The Hook:** A genre-defining masterpiece that successfully fuses the deadly spin of Chinese tackiness with the explosive power of high-tension Japanese engineering.
* **Archetype:** Modern Hybrid Power-Looper.

## 2. Performance Analysis
* **Speed & Gears:**
    * **Passive Block Speed:** Surprisingly restrained. Due to the sticky top sheet and hard sponge, the ball does not rocket off the paddle during passive blocking, requiring the player to add slight forward momentum.
    * **Active Loop Speed:** High to Very High. When the player uses proper weight transfer and fully engages the Spring Sponge X, the rubber releases tremendous energy. It is not "free speed" like Tenergy 64; it is "earned speed."
    * **Linearity:** Extremely linear. There is almost zero unpredictable trampoline effect. You get exactly what you put in, making it a scalpel for precision play.
* **Spin Generation:**
    * **Top End:** Best-in-class. The combination of surface tack and the dense sponge allows for immense rotational torque on the ball. Counter-loops close to the table dip viciously.
    * **Opening Loop:** Exceptional. The tacky surface grabs the plastic ball effortlessly, allowing players to brush thin against heavy backspin with high confidence. The "slip" effect found in some non-tacky rubbers is virtually non-existent here.
* **Control & Short Game:**
    * **Touch Play:** This is the rubber's secret weapon. The "dead" feeling on low-impact shots allows for incredibly short, low drop shots and precise pushes that barely clear the net.
    * **Sensitivity:** High. Because it is tacky, it reacts strongly to incoming spin. Passive players will struggle; active players who "override" the incoming spin with their own stroke will thrive.
* **Throw Angle (Arc):**
    * **Trajectory:** High and curved.
    * **Clearance:** The ball launches with a high initial arc but possesses a dramatic, sharp dip (the "kick") upon bouncing, forcing opponents to block comfortably high or misjudge the bounce entirely.

## 3. The "Hand Feel" Experience
* **Impact Sensation:**
    * **Hardness:** Hard / Brick-like (57-58° ESN equivalent, 44° Butterfly scale). It feels significantly stiffer than Tenergy 05.
    * **Feedback:** Crisp yet muted on soft touches. On hard hits, you feel a distinct "crunch" as the sponge compresses. It does not feel hollow; it feels extremely solid and dense.
* **Dwell Time:**
    * **Sensation:** Despite the hard sponge, the dwell time is perceived as long due to the tacky top sheet "holding" the ball. This creates a sensation of guiding the ball rather than just hitting it.

## 4. Compatibility Guide
* **Best Blade Matches:**
    * **Outer Carbon (Viscaria/ALC/Super ALC):** The Ideal Pairing. The stiffness and speed of an outer-carbon blade compensate for the rubber's lack of low-end bounce. This combo (Viscaria + D09C) is currently the gold standard for many professional players.
    * **Inner Carbon / All-Wood:** Playable, but physically demanding. Placing this on a flexible wood blade requires the player to generate nearly all the power. Recommended only for players with elite physical conditioning or pure forehand rotational playstyles.
* **Ball Suitability:**
    * **ABS Plastic:** Flawless. The hard sponge was specifically engineered to counter the heaviness and low spin of the ABS ball. It generates rotation where other rubbers slip.

## 5. Pros & Cons
* **Pros:**
    * **Short Game Dominance:** Stops the ball dead on drop shots, preventing opponents from flicking easily.
    * **Counter-Looping:** The hard sponge does not bottom out, providing immense stability in high-speed rallies.
    * **Serve Spin:** The tacky surface generates massive spin on service, often winning points outright on the third ball attack.
* **Cons:**
    * **Physical Demand:** It requires excellent footwork and full strokes to activate. Lazy swings result in the ball dumping into the net.
    * **Weight:** It is a heavy rubber (cut weight approx. 50g+), which can make the racket head-heavy.
    * **Price:** It sits at the very top of the price bracket, making it a significant investment.

## 6. Recommended Users & Pairings
* **Who Should Buy This:**
    * **Advanced Competition Players:** Specifically those with good technique who find Tenergy too bouncy in the short game.
    * **Forehand Power Attackers:** Players who rely on opening up with heavy spin and finishing with power loops.
* **Who Should Avoid This:**
    * **Beginners/Low Intermediate:** The hardness and spin sensitivity will lead to more unforced errors than winners.
    * **Passive Blockers:** If you rely on the rubber's bounce to return the ball, this will feel like hitting with a piece of wood.
* **Similar Alternatives:**
    * **Same Brand:** **Butterfly Glayzer 09C**. A softer, more forgiving, and cheaper version of Dignics 09C, ideal for developing players.
    * **Rival Brand:** **Tibhar Hybrid K3**. Offers a similar hybrid feel but with a slightly livelier catapult effect and shorter lifespan. **Rakza Z (Extra Hard)** is another viable, more budget-friendly hybrid option.
